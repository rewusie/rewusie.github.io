    <p>If you’re at all into rock music or grunge-y music, Daughtry is a band that is worth a listen.
        Daughtry is a six-person band, made up of Chris Daughtry,
        the lead vocalist, rhythm ,and lead guitarist; Josh Steely, also lead guitar and backup vocalist; Josh Paul,
        bass guitarist and backup vocalist;
        Brian Craddock, rhythm guitarist; Elvio Fernandes, keyboardist and occasional rhythm guitarist; and Brandon
        Maclin, drummer and percussionist. </p>

    <p>Chris Daughtry was a finalist on the fifth season of American Idol in 2006, and hails from North Carolina,
        according to IMDb.
        Daughtry has a background in guitar, musical theater, and rock; he was part of a high school rock band called
        Cadence
        that released one album in 1999.
        After finishing fourth on American Idol, Daughtry went on to form a band of the same name and produce three
        studio albums within seven years.</p>

    <p>The first album, Daughtry, was the “fastest-selling debut album in SoundScan history.” (All Music)
        Leave This Town and Break the Spell were the next two albums to be released; these albums carried on the band’s
        signature rock sound
        and brought about the leading single “Renegade.”
        The next three albums were Baptized, Cage to Rattle, and their newest one, Dearly Beloved, which came out in
        September 2021.
        The University of Maryland community is somewhat familiar with Daughtry’s music, but it seems that rock is not
        the average person’s
        first choice of genre when it comes to music.</p>

    <p>According to a survey taken by 20 people who are students, faculty members, or are in some way affiliated with
        UMD,
        only 45% of people knew of the band Daughtry.
        Daughtry has four acclaimed songs that topped the charts in the past: It’s Not Over, Crashed, What I Want, and
        The Past.
        Only 20% of respondents had heard any of these songs, and the most recognized one was It’s Not Over, followed by
        What I Want.</p>

    <p>Recently, Chris Daughtry lost his daughter Hannah days before a lineup of shows the band had planned to perform
        for their Dearly Beloved Tour.
        Hannah was 25.
        According to Instagram posts by Deanna Daughtry, Hannah’s mother and Daughtry’s wife, the cause of death is
        still being investigated.
        Hannah was found dead in her home in Nashville on Nov. 12.
        The band was in the middle of their Dearly Beloved tour, having released an album of the same name on Sept. 17
        this year.
        It is the sixth studio album from the band, according to Wikipedia, and the first since their last album Cage to
        Rattle, which came out in 2018.
        95% of respondents to the survey had not heard about Hannah’s death upon taking the survey,
        and there was an even split between people who heard the news due to the survey or because of an online article.
    </p>

    <p>None of the respondents had heard any of the songs from Daughtry’s newest album.</p>

    <p>The band is classified as Active Rock on Billboard and has two top Ten Hits on the Billboard Charts.
        The song that peaked the highest on the charts was “It’s Not Over” in March 2007, peaking at #5 and spending 20
        weeks on the charts.
        The band does not have any No. 1 hits.
        The only four songs from the band that broke the charts were “It’s Not Over,” “What I Want” featuring Slash,
        “Crashed,” and “The Past”
        featuring Sevendust.</p>
